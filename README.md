# Android Squad Roadmap

We are in **[CIS Team](https://cisteam.org/)** introduce to you the best road to help you to learn Android Track **by Java Programming Language**

![cis logo](./images/logo.png)

Android :is a [mobile operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system) **based on a modified version of the** [**Linux kernel**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel 'Linux kernel') and other [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software 'Open-source software') software, designed primarily for [**touchscreen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen 'Touchscreen') mobile devices such as [**smartphones**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone 'Smartphone') and [**tablets**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer 'Tablet computer')**.**

## Notes:

- We Recommend to read more and more about Android and his History
- We recommend to you first to have good Knowledge about:

  1. OOP
  2. Database
  3. Operating System

# Level 0:

![java logo](./images/java.jpeg)

**Java** is a [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language 'High-level programming language'), [class-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming 'Class-based programming'), [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming 'Object-oriented programming') [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language 'Programming language') that is designed to have as few implementation [dependencies](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_(computer_science)> 'Dependency (computer science)') as possible. It is a [general-purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_language 'General-purpose language') programming language intended to let [application developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_developer) _write once._

# Level 1:

![android logo](./images/android.jpg)

In this level we will learn principle of designing user interface, interacting with design and dealing with multi-screen in app.

## Resources:

- [user Interface Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-interface--ud834)
- [User Input](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-input--ud836)
- [Multiscreen](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839)

`Try to make Calculator app with what you learned for example or any task for improving your skill`

---

# Level 2:

First we will learn recycler view:

![android logo](./images/recyclerview.png)

`RecyclerView makes it easy to efficiently display large sets of data. You supply the data and define how each item looks, and the RecyclerView library dynamically creates the elements when they're needed.`

## Resources:

![data storage image](./images/data-storage.png)

**SQLite** is **a** [**relational database management system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system) (RDBMS) contained in a [**C**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)> 'C (programming language)') [**library**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computer_science)> 'Library (computer science)'). In contrast to many other database management systems, SQLite is not a [client‚Äìserver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server 'Client‚Äìserver') database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program.

![sqlite and android image](./images/sqlite-and-android.jpg)

In this level you will learn about data storage in android but we recommend to you to refresh the basic of database

## Resources:

- [Database basic](https://maharatech.gov.eg/enrol/index.php?id=740)

## `Now we will learn architecture patterns. üî•üî•`

![architecture patterns image](./images/architecture-patterns.jpg)

**Architectural pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in [**software architecture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture 'Computer hardware') within a given context.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern#cite_note-TMD-1) The architectural patterns address various issues in [**software engineering**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering 'Software engineering'), such as [**computer hardware**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware) performance limitations, [**high availability**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability 'High availability') and minimization of a [**business risk**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_risk 'Business risk'). Some architectural patterns have been implemented within [**software frameworks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework 'Software framework').
